# Project Name and Description

[*The 4.2 ka event and the end of the Maltese ‘Temple Period’*]()

This repo contains the code required to replicate the analysis described in study of the relationship between climate change and the end of the Maltese Temple Period.

A DOI for the relevant paper will be added to this document after acceptance to a peer-reviewed journal.

## Repo Archive
TBD. A Zenodo DOI for an archived version of this repo will also be added after the associated paper has been accepted.

## Data
The key datasets necessary for replication have been included in this repo under the Data folder. There are also, however, much larger datasets that the data_prep.R script in this folder produces. Some of these are produced as a result of random sampling. They are very large and stored as R bigmatrix files (R::bigmemory). Because of the file sizes (many GBs), we uploaded the ones we produced for our analyses directly to Zenodo instead of trying to store them with GitHub. They will be archived at Zenodo after the associated paper has been accepted and can be accessed with the following DOI (different from the DOI for this code repo):

10.5281/zenodo.5354992
